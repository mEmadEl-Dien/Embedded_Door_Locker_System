# Embedded_Door_Locker_Project
This is an Embedded field related project, which is done by the Layered model and drivers,

This is a Door Locker system made by a LCD, dc-motor, buzzer, KeyPad and controlled by TWO AVR ATMEGA16 microcontrollers,

This Project is consisted of the following drivers: Timer (Commercial), UART, SPI(TWI), External EEPROM, dc-motor, Buzzer, LCD , Keypad , GPIO , and (std_types and common macros) libraries,

It's a door-locker service provided for the user who can save his password, change it and open a door, this is done via two microcontrollers, one to take the input password or order and display the output state, the other one is for controlling the whole system (for example checking if the password was correct or not),

And for the simulation on proteus, follow this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IB7SCjgjIQRpnf-3Y-ZN2IyvPC0r9FQG?usp=sharing .
